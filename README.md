# COIN WARS
Here's a fun text-based version of a game called Coin Wars. Coin Wars
is a physical, tactile, turn-based, stategy game. That's to say: players
take turns flicking coins trying to knock their opponent's pieces off a
table. There's two teams: heads and tails. The last player with coins still on
the table wins.

To spice things up, different coins have special abilities. Dimes are light,
easy to knock around, and don't pack much of a punch when they're trying to
push other coins off the table. However! Dimes convert other coins. If a
dime is flicked and hits another coin then that coin is flipped, like flipped
from heads to tails. A player can flick one dime to tap two enemy quarters
and flip them so they're on the dime's team now.
